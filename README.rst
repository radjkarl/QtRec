======================================================
QtRec - Qt + save, load, undo, redo 
======================================================

- Fork the code on `github <https://github.com/radjkarl/qtrec>`_


Acts like PyQt.QtGui but records certain events for widgets called over it.
Thereby the current state can be *saved*, *undo* and *redo* are possible without 
extra programming.

Executing save() creates a python scipt which restores the saved state.

See the Examples for more information.
